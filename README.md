# Tribute Page

I built a tribute page using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It's my first attempt on responsive web design and... it's quite fun! But it still requires more practice.

## Full Design

 <table>
  <tr>
    <td>Mobile</td>
     <td>Mobile with Navbar</td>
     <td>Mobile with Content</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="assets/mobile.png"></td>
    <td><img src="assets/mobile_with_navbar.png"></td>
    <td><img src="assets/mobile_with_content.png"></td>
  </tr>
 </table>
